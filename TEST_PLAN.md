## Testing Methodologies

### 1. Unit Testing with Edge Case Coverage

**Scope**: Individual functions and components
**Runs**: 50+ unit tests covering all public interfaces

Key features:
- Boundary value analysis for all numeric inputs
- String/ByteArray manipulation edge cases
- Zero/maximum value handling
- Error condition validation

Example test patterns:
```cairo
#[test]
fn test_health_calculation_edge_cases()

#[test]
#[should_panic(expected: ('Invalid input',))]
fn test_invalid_input_handling()
```

### 2. Fuzz Testing Implementation

**Scope**: Property-based testing with random inputs
**Runs**: 35,000+ fuzzing iterations across all components

Coverage areas:
- AdventurerVerbose stat combinations (10,000 runs)
- Base64 encoding with random byte sequences (8,000 runs)  
- SVG generation with dynamic parameters (6,000 runs)
- String conversion with u256 values (4,500 runs)
- Equipment and bag configurations (6,500 runs)

Example fuzz patterns:
```cairo
#[test]
#[fuzzer(runs: 5000, seed: 12345)]
fn fuzz_adventurer_stats_comprehensive(
    health: u16,
    level: u16,
    strength: u8,
    vitality: u8,
    token_id: u256
)
```

### 3. Fork Testing with Real Network Data

**Scope**: Integration with Sepolia testnet state
**Configuration**: `SEPOLIA_LATEST` fork in `Scarb.toml`

Test scenarios:
- Contract deployment on forked network
- Real adventurer data integration
- Gas cost analysis under network conditions
- State consistency across blocks
- Performance under network constraints

### 4. Advanced Cheatcodes Testing

**Scope**: Complex state manipulation and context control
**Tools**: Starknet Foundry cheatcodes

Capabilities:
- Caller address spoofing and isolation
- Block timestamp/number manipulation
- Sequencer and chain ID modification
- Storage introspection and validation
- Event spying and validation

### 5. Security-Focused Testing

**Scope**: Comprehensive security analysis
**Focus**: Input validation, injection resistance, DoS protection

Security test categories:
- Malicious AdventurerVerbose data handling
- Injection attack resistance (XSS, SQL-like, script injection)
- Buffer overflow protection
- Access control validation
- State integrity under attack
- Cryptographic security of Base64 encoding

### 6. Performance and Gas Optimization

**Scope**: Gas efficiency and scalability analysis
**Metrics**: Gas usage, memory efficiency, operation scaling

Performance benchmarks:
- AdventurerVerbose rendering operations
- Base64 encoding scalability (10-500 byte inputs)
- SVG generation complexity scaling
- Contract deployment and initialization
- Batch operation efficiency

### 7. Property-Based and Invariant Testing

**Scope**: System-wide invariants and mathematical properties
**Runs**: 12,000+ property validation tests

Critical invariants tested:
- Deterministic rendering: Same input → Same output
- Health calculation: Always `100 + (vitality * 15)`
- Data URI format: Always proper JSON/SVG Base64 encoding
- SVG structure: Always well-formed XML
- Base64 properties: Correct padding and character sets
- String conversion: Only digits, no leading zeros
- State consistency: Read operations don't modify state

## Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
scarb test

# Run with coverage
snforge test --coverage

# Generate coverage report
snforge coverage

# Run specific test categories
snforge test unit::
snforge test fuzz::

snforge test performance::
```

### Test Configuration

Key settings in `Scarb.toml`:
```toml
[tool.snforge]
max_n_steps = 500000000                # Increased for complex rendering

[[tool.snforge.fork]]
name = "SEPOLIA_LATEST"
url = "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia"
block_id.tag = "latest"

[profile.dev.cairo]
unstable-add-statements-code-locations-debug-info = true
unstable-add-statements-functions-debug-info = true
inlining-strategy = "avoid"
```

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing Pipeline

The test suite is designed for CI/CD integration:

5. **Coverage Reporting**: Automated coverage analysis

### Test Artifacts

Generated artifacts include:
- Coverage reports (`coverage/coverage.lcov`)
- Gas usage analytics

- Performance benchmarks
- Test execution traces

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development

1. **Write Tests First**: Define expected behavior through tests
2. **Implement Features**: Code to pass the test requirements
3. **Refactor Safely**: Maintain test coverage during refactoring
4. **Security Review**: Run security tests before deployment

### Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality:

1. Add unit tests to appropriate `unit/` module
2. Add fuzz tests for input validation
3. Update integration tests if interfaces change
4. Add security tests for new attack vectors
5. Update performance baselines
6. Document new test patterns

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Mock Death Mountain Systems integration (requires real contract addresses)
- Limited network fork testing (dependent on testnet availability)
- Gas optimization benchmarks are implementation-dependent

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with live Death Mountain Systems contracts
- Automated gas regression testing
- Property-based test generation from specifications
- Advanced mutation testing
- Load testing for high-volume scenarios

This comprehensive test plan ensures the Death Mountain Renderer system is production-ready with:

- **Robustness**: Extensive edge case coverage and fuzz testing
- **Security**: Comprehensive attack resistance validation  
- **Performance**: Gas optimization and scalability verification
- **Reliability**: Deterministic behavior and invariant maintenance
